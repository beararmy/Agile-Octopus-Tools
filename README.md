The bulk of this code is written as functions which can be called in either an automated fashion (ie to periodically check in and get prices, then drop into a DB) or more point in time data (ie what is the current price).

- [x] Centralised config in json or php

- [x] Display all of todays prices
- [x] Display Cheapest few hours today
- [x] Drop prices into mysql db for later analysis
- [x] Drop past consumption into mysql db
- [ ] Make it an Azure Function to update DB rather than curl against a webpage
- [ ] Email alerts for following day 'avoid at x, use lots at y'
